# PE Learning App

A self-paced, client-side web app for building Private Equity fluency. Designed for CFA charterholders with public-markets backgrounds who need to get up to speed on PE concepts quickly.

---

## What it does

- Walks you through a 20-lesson curriculum covering PE fund structure, performance metrics, strategy, manager selection, portfolio construction, and more.
- After each lesson you take a short quiz, rate your confidence, and mark the lesson complete.
- A review queue surfaces flashcards and mini-cases from completed lessons, prioritized by how long ago you finished each lesson.
- A dashboard shows module progress, cards due for review, and your weakest topics.
- All state is stored in `localStorage` — no account, no backend, no data leaves your browser.

## Curriculum structure

One module: **Private Equity Foundations** (`pe-foundations`)

- **20 lessons** (Day 1–20), ~20–30 min each
- Difficulties: foundational → intermediate → advanced
- Each lesson has prerequisites, learning objectives, content blocks, and a short quiz
- **60 review cards** (3 per lesson): flashcards, mini-cases, and reteach cards

Day range overview:
- Days 1–6: Fund mechanics, GP/LP, capital calls, J-curve, IRR, multiples, fund lifecycle
- Days 7–10: Buyout, growth equity, venture, value creation, exits
- Days 11–16: Fund terms, manager selection, benchmarking (PME), portfolio construction, secondaries, co-investments
- Days 17–20: Asset allocation, reporting/NAV, ESG, synthesis

---

## Progress and review logic

**Progress** (`localStorage` key: `pe-app-progress`)
- Each lesson has a status: `not-started` | `in-progress` | `completed`
- `in-progress` and `completed` are timestamped
- Completing a lesson requires finishing the quiz and saving a confidence rating (1–5)

**Review queue** (`localStorage` key: `pe-app-review`)
- Only lessons that are `in-progress` or `completed` surface review cards
- Priority is computed from time since completion: in-progress = high; >7 days = high; 2–7 days = medium; <2 days = low
- Cards are sorted high → medium → low, then by day number within each group
- "Done for now" dismisses a card for the rest of the calendar day; it reappears the next day

**Quiz results** (`localStorage` key: `pe-app-quiz`) store score (fraction correct) and confidence per lesson.

## Local setup

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd pe-learning-app
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

Node 18+ required. No database or backend setup needed.

---

## Environment variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` (never commit `.env.local`):

```
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=
```

- `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` — your [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai) key. If set, AI helper buttons appear automatically on lesson and review pages. Leave blank (or omit) to disable AI entirely.

The app works fully without AI. When the key is absent, all AI UI is hidden.

---

## Deploying to Vercel

1. Push the repo to GitHub
2. Import the project in [Vercel](https://vercel.com)
3. Add environment variables in the Vercel project settings:
   - `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` — set this to enable AI helper; omit to disable
4. Deploy — no build configuration needed beyond the defaults for Next.js

Because all user data is in `localStorage`, there is nothing to provision server-side.
