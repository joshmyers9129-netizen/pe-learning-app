          "The GP's head of investor relations slides a fund summary across the table: 'Fund IV is $3.2 billion, currently 68% deployed in year three, with a $1.1 billion NAV and a 35% follow-on reserve against remaining commitments.' In one sentence: four distinct concepts — deployment pace relative to the investment period, interim NAV versus paid-in capital, follow-on reserve adequacy, and committed versus deployed capital. If you don't have the fund model internalized, you cannot interrogate any of them in real time. This lesson builds that model.",

        content:
          "Every PE metric — IRR, TVPI, DPI, PME — is anchored in the fund structure. Without the structural model, you cannot identify when IRR is being distorted — whether by a subscription line (a revolving credit facility secured against uncalled LP commitments, used to bridge acquisitions before calling LP capital; this delays the LP's cash outflow date and mechanically inflates reported IRR without improving LP economics) or by early exit concentration — why NAV is not the same thing as value, or why a year-3 performance number is nearly useless for cross-fund comparison. A CFA charterholder approaching PE with a public-equity mental model — continuous liquidity, daily NAV, mark-to-market pricing — will have systematically wrong intuitions across every dimension of PE analysis. The fund model is not introductory material you learn once and shelve. It is the analytical skeleton on which all subsequent PE reasoning hangs.",

        title: "The closed-end structure: design, not constraint",
        content:
          "A PE fund is a closed-end vehicle — the capital pool is fixed at close, with no new subscriptions, no redemptions, and no daily NAV. The fund has a defined term (typically 10 years, with one or two one-year extension rights subject to LP approval). LPs cannot exit by redeeming their interest; secondary market sales to a willing buyer are the only exit path. This design is deliberate. It enables three things the PE return model requires: the illiquidity premium — LPs surrender liquidity and expect compensation in return; multi-year operational control — a GP with a stable capital base can execute 3–5 year operational improvements without the threat of capital withdrawal; and incentive alignment — carry is earned on fund-level total returns across the fund's full life, not on quarterly NAV marks. The analogy to a listed closed-end fund (CEF) is imperfect: a CEF trades at a market price that may diverge sharply from NAV, while a PE fund has neither. The governing legal document — the limited partnership agreement (LPA) — defines the structure, terms, and GP authority.",

        content:
          "When an LP signs the LPA and commits $50 million, they are making a legally binding obligation to fund capital calls up to $50 million over the fund's life — not writing a check. The GP calls capital — issues a formal capital call notice — when funds are needed: to close an investment, pay management fees, or cover fund expenses. Notices typically require LP funding within 10 business days, though specific terms vary by LPA. This distinction is critical at every level of analysis. A fund with $2 billion in commitments and $800 million called at year 2 is an $800 million fund operationally — the remaining $1.2 billion is a contingent obligation on LP balance sheets. Deployment pace — the rate at which the GP calls and deploys capital — affects the fee base, shapes the J-curve, and drives the IRR calculation. An LP managing a $200 million PE allocation across six funds may have $120–150 million in uncalled commitments outstanding simultaneously, all callable with 10 days' notice. This is not a theoretical liquidity risk; it is a recurring operational reality for any institutional LP with a meaningful PE program.",

        content:
          "Unfunded commitments — the gap between what an LP has committed and what has been called — sit as a contingent liability until drawn. This creates three structural risks that LPs frequently underestimate. First, timing correlation: GPs often accelerate capital calls during favorable deal environments, which historically coincide with periods when LP liquid portfolios face competing demands. Second, over-commitment mechanics: institutional LPs routinely commit 1.2–1.5x their target PE allocation on the empirical basis that GPs historically call 85–95% of commitments over a fund's life. This works until multiple GPs in a portfolio simultaneously reach high deployment in a single vintage year, concentrating liquidity demand. Third, default risk: failure to fund a capital call within the LPA-defined notice period triggers severe contractual penalties — typically suspension of voting rights, forced sale of LP interest at a significant discount (often 50–75 cents on the dollar), or forfeiture of the uncalled balance. ILPA Principles 3.0 recommends 15+ business days' notice as best practice, but this is advisory, not a legal requirement.",

          "The investment period (typically years 1–5, sometimes 4–6) defines the GP's authority to make new platform investments. Once it closes, called capital can only be used for follow-on investments in existing portfolio companies and for fund expenses — a significant constraint on GP discretion. The harvest phase has no clean start date: GPs exit when conditions allow, which may compress into years 7–9 (typical) or extend to year 10 and beyond (common when credit markets tighten or exit multiples compress). This temporal ambiguity has material implications for performance measurement. A fund that completes most exits in year 7 versus year 9 of a 10-year life will show meaningfully different IRRs even with identical terminal multiples — because IRR is highly sensitive to cash flow timing. Tracking investment period close against current fund age is a basic allocator data point that most investors underutilize.",

        title: "Capital flow anatomy: commitment to distribution",
        content:
          "Tracing a dollar of committed capital through the fund lifecycle: (1) LP commits $1.00 — the dollar sits in the LP's liquid portfolio, subject to call. (2) GP issues a capital call; LP funds approximately $0.90 net of any management fee offsets that year. If the fund uses a subscription line credit facility — a short-term revolving facility secured by uncalled LP commitments — the GP may bridge the acquisition with the credit line and call LP capital weeks later. This delays LP cash outflow and mechanically inflates reported IRR without improving the LP's actual economics. (3) GP closes an acquisition — the called equity plus debt financing (typically 4–6x EBITDA for a buyout) funds the enterprise value. (4) Portfolio company operates under GP oversight; GP marks it quarterly for NAV purposes — LP sees TVPI build, but it is unrealized. (5) GP exits via trade sale, sponsor-to-sponsor transaction, or IPO; gross proceeds flow to the fund. (6) A distribution waterfall governs how gross proceeds are sequenced: LP capital is returned first, then LPs receive their preferred return (typically 8% per annum compounded), and only after these thresholds does the GP earn carried interest on remaining profits. This sequencing matters because it defines when GP economics begin — American and European waterfall structures differ on this question. Full mechanics are in Day 11. (7) LP receives a net cash distribution. DPI at any point reflects only what has been wired; RVPI reflects GP-determined interim value for the remaining portfolio. A fund with TVPI 1.8x and DPI 0.3x has mostly unrealized, unconfirmed returns — a distinction that is not cosmetic.",

Years 1–2: GP calls $600 million (30% of commitments) for 4 platform acquisitions at $150 million average equity per deal. Management fees: $40 million/year on committed capital. NAV marked near cost. Net IRR: −4% (fee drag before any realized gains; structurally expected). Years 3–4: Additional $800 million called for 4 more platforms and follow-ons. Total called: $1.4 billion. No exits. Three companies marked up on EBITDA growth. TVPI: 1.15x, DPI: 0.0x, Net IRR: ~3% (J-curve still dominant). Years 5–7: First exits begin. Trade sale of Company A — acquired for $150 million equity, sold for $330 million equity value, 2.2x gross MOIC. Partial IPO of Company B. DPI builds to 0.40x. TVPI: 1.45x, Net IRR: ~12%. Years 8–10: Harvest accelerates. Five of eight remaining companies exit. Final two held in continuing NAV. Net TVPI: 1.85x, DPI: 1.55x, RVPI: 0.30x, Net IRR: 16.5%. The year-2 IRR of −4% and the year-10 IRR of 16.5% describe the same fund — one of the most important structural insights in all of PE analysis. A manager presenting their year-3 metrics at a first meeting is showing you the J-curve trough, not their track record. Deal mechanics behind Company A's 2.2x gross MOIC: entry at $50M trailing EBITDA, 8x EV/EBITDA = $400M enterprise value. Financing: $150M LP equity contribution, $250M acquisition debt (5x EBITDA). Four-year hold — EBITDA grown to $65M through margin improvement and a bolt-on acquisition; exit multiple held at 8x = $520M EV. Debt reduced to $190M through operating cash flow. Exit equity: $520M − $190M = $330M. Gross MOIC: $330M ÷ $150M = 2.2x. Without leverage, the same $400M → $520M EV appreciation (30% total gain) returns only $150M × 1.30 = $195M — a 1.3x MOIC rather than 2.2x. Financial leverage amplified a modest 30% EV gain into a 120% equity return. This is why entry EV/EBITDA multiple and acquisition leverage quantum are the two variables most closely interrogated in any buyout discussion.",

          "A PE fund is a blind pool — the LP commits capital before the portfolio is constructed. At the time of commitment, the GP may have one or two warehoused deals, but the majority of the portfolio is unidentified. The LP is buying GP judgment, sourcing capability, and operational capacity — not a portfolio. This structural fact has several decision-relevant implications. First, past performance is the primary evidence available in manager selection, which creates the question of what predictive content it carries — a contested empirical question covered in Day 12. Second, the LPA defines the investment mandate: permitted sectors, geographies, deal size ranges, concentration limits, and leverage parameters. An LP who has not reviewed the LPA (or at minimum the PPM summary) does not know what the GP is authorized to do with their capital. Third, fund sequence matters: a GP managing their final fund before a senior departure has different incentives than one building toward Fund V. GP team continuity and succession planning are frequently underweighted in LP diligence.",

          "GPs use fund-model vocabulary precisely in meetings. A CFA-fluent LP who does not speak this language will be dependent on GP framing. Key terms: 'Committed capital' — total LP obligations, including uncalled. 'Paid-in capital' (also 'called capital') — actual cash drawn from LPs to date. 'Invested capital' — capital deployed into portfolio companies (paid-in minus management fees and expenses). 'NAV' — GP-determined fair value of the remaining portfolio per FASB ASC 820 and IPEV guidelines. 'TVPI' — (distributions + NAV) / paid-in; the total value multiple. 'DPI' — distributions / paid-in; the realized multiple, the only confirmed performance. 'RVPI' — NAV / paid-in; the unrealized component of TVPI. 'Gross IRR' — fund-level return before management fees and carry. 'Net IRR' — LP-level return after all fees and carry; the only number that matters for LP comparison. 'Follow-on reserve' — portion of committed capital reserved for subsequent investments in existing portfolio companies. In a meeting, 'Fund IV is 68% deployed in year three' means the GP has called approximately 68% of total commitments three years into a 5-year investment period — somewhat ahead of average pace — leaving roughly 32% (less the follow-on reserve) available for new platforms.",

Weak LP response: 'That's impressive pace — what are you seeing in terms of entry multiples right now?' Why it's weak: the LP has accepted the GP's framing, pivoted to a generic market question, and completely missed the most important structural implication of 68% deployment in year three of a five-year investment period. Strong LP response: 'With 68% called and two years remaining in the investment period, your remaining investable capacity is roughly $640 million — but how much of that is reserved for follow-ons in your existing portfolio companies? Are any companies likely to require incremental capital beyond your original reserve estimates?' Why it's strong: it deconstructs the remaining investable capital into new-platform capacity versus follow-on reserve, identifies the relevant risk (follow-on reserve adequacy as the portfolio matures), and signals that the LP understands the structural difference between deployment pace and available new-platform capacity. This is the distinction between an LP who has the fund model internalized and one who is following the GP's narrative.",

        content:
          "At year four of a typical 10-year buyout fund, reported metrics include DPI, TVPI, and net IRR. What can be reliably concluded: deployment pace (compare called capital to the investment period to assess whether the GP is behind, on pace, or ahead for new platforms); confirmed realized value (DPI is cash actually wired to LPs, not subject to valuation interpretation); whether any early exits have occurred. What cannot be reliably concluded: ultimate fund performance. Year-4 IRR is mechanically distorted by the J-curve and by the timing of any early exits — a single early exit in year 3 can double the reported interim IRR regardless of portfolio quality. The RVPI component of TVPI is GP-determined fair value per ASC 820 methodologies (comparable transactions, DCF, last-round pricing) and while audited for process, it is not market-confirmed. Cambridge Associates' benchmark methodology limits interim performance comparisons to funds where at least 60–70% of economic life has elapsed, on the basis that earlier metrics have insufficient predictive validity. Harris, Jenkinson, and Kaplan (2014) corroborate this pattern: fund quartile rankings based on early interim metrics shift substantially by final realization, meaning a year-4 top-quartile label carries far less signal than a year-8 one.

          "The fund model creates three structural portfolio management challenges for any LP allocating across multiple PE managers. First, pacing risk: an LP committing $150 million per year across four to six funds simultaneously may have $400–600 million in uncalled commitments outstanding at any time. A pacing model — projecting expected capital calls by fund and year against available liquid reserves — is not optional; it is a basic operational tool for a functioning PE program. Over-commitment works until multiple GPs simultaneously accelerate calls in a strong vintage year, creating a call crisis against a single LP's liquidity position. Second, vintage year concentration: the fund model's 3–5 year investment periods mean that two sequential fund commitments may acquire companies at materially different macro conditions. A PE portfolio concentrated in two or three vintage years carries macro-entry risk that is invisible on a portfolio NAV report but often materializes in the harvest phase. Third, the denominator effect: when public markets sell off sharply, PE NAVs are slow to mark down because GP interim valuations lag market conditions. This mechanically inflates the apparent portfolio weight of PE even as the economic value of those companies has likely declined. Understanding this as a structural artifact of the fund model — not a signal of PE outperformance — is essential for avoiding forced rebalancing decisions at the worst time.",

A fund deploying in 2012–2015 and exiting 2016–2019 benefited from multiple expansion and low financing costs that improved IRR independent of manager skill; a fund deploying in 2007–2010 faced peak entry multiples and the credit crisis. Cross-vintage IRR comparison conflates manager decisions with macro environment. A rigorous comparison requires PME (public market equivalent) methodology — replicating each fund's exact capital call and distribution timing against a public index to isolate the return attributable to the manager over the market alternative. Kaplan-Schoar PME, mPME (Cambridge Associates), and Direct Alpha are the three most common PME methods. Vintage year diversification is the LP-level portfolio implication: no single vintage year should dominate a PE program.",

(2) Confirmed realized value — DPI is cash actually wired to LPs; it is not subject to valuation methodology or GP discretion. Not reliably concludable: (1) Ultimate fund performance — year-4 IRR and TVPI are heavily distorted by J-curve mechanics and GP interim marks; Harris, Jenkinson, and Kaplan (2014) find that interim PE metrics have limited predictive validity before 60–70% of fund economic life has elapsed.

        modelAnswer:
          "The risk is not simple cash availability but the intersection of three factors: (1) timing correlation — GPs tend to accelerate calls during strong deal environments, which historically overlap with periods when LP liquid portfolios face competing demands; (2) simultaneous calls — an LP running an over-committed portfolio may face multiple GPs calling simultaneously in an active vintage year, concentrating liquidity demand in a short window; (3) severe default penalties — failing to fund a call within the LPA-defined notice period triggers contractual penalties including loss of voting rights, forced sale of LP interest at 50–75 cents on the dollar, and forfeiture of uncalled balance. A functioning PE program requires a formal pacing model, a dedicated unfunded commitment reserve (typically 25–35% of uncalled commitments in liquid instruments), and stress testing of simultaneous call scenarios. 'Having cash available' is not the same as being structurally prepared for PE's specific call mechanics.",
